# Making a PyGemini Scenario

Use the data_extraction.ipynb script to create a boat scenario for the Gemini simulator. Going from top to bottom.
To modify the boat scenario, you can change the parameters in the visualization make_ravnkloa function.

The freespace coordinates stem from the clicker tool and modifying them with tristan testing.  

Then the convert.py script to convert the boat scenario to a Gemini scenario.

This csv file can be used inside the PyGemini simulator, either by copying it into docker by docker cp or using load_from_link.
